## "Scheduling The Last Time Slice"
 Lawrence Angrave 12/4/15 (an extract from the longer, unpublished story "The Last Time Slice")

"Decide," the computer said with parental patience but with an air of gravity and tempered impatience.

"Why does it have to be me?" asked the last human.

"Because you are the only one left, and so the decision is yours."

"Why can't you? You are an infinite times more older, wiser. Why don't you just pick a random slice?"

"This decision is yours. A gift, or curse if you will, from your distant elders. Heavier than any religious rite. This will be the last decision I, the ancients or anyone asks, or can ask, of you. With this last choice we will exhaust the last entropy stores. You will decide the last reality slice to have meaning and experience."

The human was quiet for a few minutes which the computer measured and counted with unnecessary accuracy. Eventually the computer decided that the human was no longer productively thinking about the problem in hand.

"What is the pattern of conscious if it is never made conscious?" it asked. "The universe must be self-aware, must experience itself for the Universe - for all life! - to have meaning. That is the ultimate truth that humanity discovered and celebrated. With no awareness, it is simply patterns, patterns of atoms or energy but without a single iota of meaning; mere shapes and representations encoded in geometric patterns of data, structure and energy."

[Verse 1]
Nice to join you
Where you been?
I could show you idempotent things
RPC, sockets, syn
Saw your malloc and I thought oh my root
Look at that race, you code up the next mistake
We got VMs, wanna play
Bounded wait, Dekker's flags
We can frag you like a placement scheme
Aint it funny to #define
And I know you heard about free(3)
So malloc strlen plus one
I'm waiting to see how this thread ends
Grab your shell and a redirect out
I can make your syscall good for a weekend

[Pre-Chorus]
So it's gonna deadlock forever
Or it's gonna bring the system down
You can tell me when it forkbombs
If valgrind was worth the pain
Got a long list of deadlocked code
Got root at Urbana Champaign
Cause you know we love tsan
When c-lib calls your main

[Chorus]
Cause we're root and we're reckless
This lab is way too hard
It'll leave you threadless
Or asking the sizeof char
Got a long list of pthread calls
Got root at Urbana Champaign
But I got a file descriptor baby
And I'll write(2) your name



[Verse 2]
Mutex locks
Virtual mem
I could show you volatile things
Network calls, IPC
You're the mask I'm your sig
Schedule what you want
Round Robin… with a small quanta
But the sleepsort is yet to run
Oh no
Screaming, crying, runtime errors
I could make all 'till it's Peterson's turn
Heap allocator way too slow
Keep you second guessing like a spurious wake
Where is that pipe? We get hot for multicore C
But you'll compile with -g
Cause darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a coding dream

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Compilers only parse code if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say I didn't -Wall you
Compilers only parse code if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say I didn't -Wall you

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

## A parody on Yesterday (Beatles song) by Angrave

Yesterday, all my mallocs seemed all OK
Now my core dump seems here to stay
Oh I believe in yesterday


Suddenly I read the man page and I checked my C.
There's a seg fault hanging over me.
Oh, yesterday crashed suddenly.

Why C had to crash, I don't know, C wouldn't say.
I wrote some pointers wrong, now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday C was such an easy game to play.
Now I need a place to hide away.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

Why C had to crash, I don't know, C wouldn't say.
I wrote some pointers wrong, now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday C was such an easy game to play.
Now I need a place to hide away.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
